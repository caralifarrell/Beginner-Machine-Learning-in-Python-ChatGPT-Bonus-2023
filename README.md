Description
Do you want to learn Machine Learning but don’t know where to start?

Have you been looking for a beginner-friendly course that will equip you with powerful tools for your career?

You’ve come to the right place!

This is Machine Learning in Python Level 1... and we will help you get started.

My name is Kirill Eremenko, I’m a Data Science instructor with over 7 years of experience, and together with my co-instructor Hadelin de Ponteves we have taught over 2M students Worldwide.

And now, we’ve created this course to help YOU get on track with Machine Learning and start applying it in YOUR career.

This course has 3 main sections:

First, we will dive into Regression, where we will learn to predict continuous variables and we will cover foundational concepts like Simple and Multiple Linear Regression, Ordinary Least Squares, Testing your Model, R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared.

In the second section you will master Logistic Regression, which is by far the most popular model for Classification. We will learn all about Maximum Likelihood, Feature Scaling, The Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Ratios.... and you will build your very first Logistic Regression!

The third and final section is all about Clustering. We will investigate the concepts of unsupervised learning and you will practice using K-Means Clustering to discover previously unseen patterns in your data.

Sound exciting?

Well, in this course not only will you learn the theory behind all of these Machine Learning models, but you will also practice applying them in different scenarios so that you are prepared for the Real World.

Plus, you will get Python code templates which you can download and keep. These are invaluable tools which you can apply in your own projects right away.

So, what are you waiting for?
